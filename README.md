🔍 Multilingual Hate Speech Detection using BERT
This project is a robust multilingual hate speech detection system built using a BERT-based model. It leverages advanced NLP techniques and translation tools to accurately identify offensive or harmful content across different languages, including Hindi, Tamil, and more.

🌐 Key Features:
Multilingual Support: Detects hate speech in multiple languages using integrated translation tools (Google Translator API, translate library).

BERT-Powered Accuracy: Utilizes a fine-tuned BERT model for high-precision sentiment and hate speech classification.

Cross-Cultural Relevance: Automatically translates and analyzes content while preserving contextual integrity.

Sentiment Analysis: Outputs sentiment classifications (e.g., Positive, Very Negative).

Confidence Scores: Delivers confidence levels with predictions for transparency and decision-making.

🧠 Example:
Input: "இன்று நான் மிகவும் மகிழ்ச்சியாக இருக்கிறேன்."

Translation: "Today I am very happy."

Sentiment: Positive

Input: "நரகத்திற்கு போ."

Translation: "Go to hell."

Sentiment: Very Negative
